# PCB design 

I have recently purchased some AM02 PSOC lora modules from Heltec and decided to test them embedded with a proper PCB. The documentation for [Arduino-compatible modules](https://heltec-automation-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cubecell/module/htcc-am02/index.html) suggests the basic passives components for a minimal configuration, autoboot with AO3400 MOSFETS, circuitry to shut down sensors during deep-sleep and battery reading via one of the 3 ACDs.
